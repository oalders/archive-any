0.931 2008-04-23
    - Resisted the urge to make large sweeping changes.  Fixed a problem with

    - DESTROY ALL TABS! [schwern]

0.92  2006-08-26
    - Added pod tests and a README for kwalitee.  Not exactly a critical
      update!

0.91  2006-08-14
    - type() is there now.  I'm not in the business of breaking other
      people's scripts.
    - Fixed several issues with the pod.
    - type() is going AWAY AWAY AWAY - use mime_type instead.  It
      actually has useful information.
    - Added a test for the backwardsness.

0.05  2003-10-20
    * Archive::Any->new($file, $type) wasn't working (thanks to Simon Wistow
      for catching this).

0.04  2003-10-20
    * Removing unzip binary hack around Archive::Zip->extractMember bug.
    - Working around new extractTree() bug which can cause directories to
      be unzipped with permissions set to 0000.
    - Fixing is_impolite() and is_naughty() so they return true or false
      instead of the scalar result of a grep.
    - Failing gracefully should Archive::Tar/Zip->new() fail.
    * Fixing list_archive() and extract_archive() misuse so we work with
      modern Archive::Tar.
    - Class::Virtually::Abstract now has a version # on CPAN.
    * is_naughty() would screw up if the first file in the archive wasn't
      a lone directory

0.03  2001-09-03
    * It is now safe to chdir() after creating an Archive::Any object

0.01  2001-08-26
